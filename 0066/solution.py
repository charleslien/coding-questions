"""
Petya has a fraction p/q, where p and q are positive integers. He wants to represent it as a sum of different unit fractions. A unit fraction is a fraction of the form 1/x, where x is a positive integer.

For example, 3/4 = 1/2 + 1/4, 5/6 = 1/2 + 1/3, 2/3 = 1/2 + 1/6.

Help Petya to find the minimum number of unit fractions needed to represent p/q as a sum of different unit fractions.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers p and q (1 ≤ p < q ≤ 10^12, gcd(p, q) = 1) — the numerator and the denominator of the fraction.


-----Output-----

Print the minimum number of different unit fractions needed to represent p/q as their sum.


-----Examples-----
