"""
Polycarp has a circle with radius r. He wants to place n points on this circle so that the minimum distance between any two points is as large as possible. The distance between two points is measured along the circle.

Help Polycarp find this maximum possible minimum distance.


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers n and r (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000) — the number of points and the radius of the circle.


-----Output-----

Print a single real number — the maximum possible minimum distance between any two points. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^-6.
